ImageJXORCrypt
==============

A simple Plug-In for popular ImageJ project. It enables one to encrypt one image with another using XOR. If the key image is
generated by a serious random function, the encryption should be quite strong as every bit in the encrpted image could be either a
1 or a 0, so there are 2^(pixels*24) (24 because of RGB) possible combinations. Of course one would not need to guess all of these to get the structure of the image.
On the other hand I cannot think of an reliable method to bruteforce such an image, because no algorithm propably can detect whether the
decrypted bits make up a real picture - so the bruteforce algorithm would not notice if he found the correct key image...

#Build the Plug-In
The project can be build using maven:

Â´mvn package' creates the Jar which then has to be copied into ImageJ's plugin folder.
